Create a new class called myarray. This class will behave
just like an array with some extra functionality. The class should have just
two private data members: a pointer to an integer, which we will use for
dynamic memory allocation, and an integer called N.

You should create a constructor that takes in an integer, sets N
equal to this value, and uses dynamic memory allocation to create memory
for N integers. You should also create a default contructor that sets the
pointer = NULL and N = 0. Similarly you should add destructors to you
class to free up any allocated memory.
Your class should have functions called void setvalue(int index) and
int getvalue(int index) that allow you to set and get the value in the array
at a given index.

You should overload the operator+ such that you can perform the
following operation in the main function A = B + C; where A, B, and C
are all objects of type myarray and the values stored in A are given by
the values stored in B follwed by the values stored in C. Therefore A has
length equal to the sum of the length of B and the length of C.
Finally, add a function to your class called void push(int newvalue);
This function should take in a new value and add it to the end of your
array. This is a little tricier than you might think as you will have to grow
the size of your array somehow to N+1.
