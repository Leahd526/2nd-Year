Create a class for a book that contains information about the title,
author, publisher, and year of publication. The class should have a constuctor
that allows you to create an object while entering all of these values. It should
also have a set values function that allows you to enter these values. Create a
new class that inherits from this class publicly, called library book. This new
class should have a variable of type bool called on loan, which indicates whether
the book is on loan. It should also have two new function called check in and
check out which change the value of on loan appropriately. This new class
should have a new constructor that creates a default value for on loan as well
as retaining the functionality of the constructor of book. Demonstrate the use
of the library book class in a main function. Your files should be stored in
book.h,book.cpp,library .book.h, library .book.cpp and driver.cpp where your
main function is locaated. For good housekeeping, put all of these files in a
single folder.
