Eason’s hired someone else before you; they completed some
work before they fell out with the Easons CTO and got themselves fired.
You’ve inherited their code, which is placed on moodle for you to download.
For the first exercise you need to download the various cpp and h files, create
an empty project using your IDE, and add all of these files. Make sure it runs
and then take some time to go through the code to make sure you understand
the work of your predecessor. They were a little lazy with commenting so you
should feel free to comment the code as you read through it and make sense of it.
The reason your predecessor was fired was because of a difference of
opinion with the CTO. The CTO believed that the book class should not
contain a data member for the number of copies; the CTO believed that
a book object should not be responsible for knowing how many copies of
the book were in a shop. Remember from the lectures that a class should
do one thing and do it well, and a book object should have the same
properties as a physical book, which would not contain information about
how many copies of it exist. Obviously the CTO was correct. The second
thing you need to do is to edit the book class such that the data member
num copies is moved into the book details class.
