# 2nd-Year
This Repository records the coding based modules I took in my second year of Robotics and Intelligent Devices.

EE108R - Computing for Engineers:                                                                                                                                 
To introduce C language programming in an embedded system environment (its key application area) assuming basic programming skills in another language. Note that it is C language programming rather than embedded systems which is the focus of this module.

EE297 - Intelligent Systems Project:                                                                                                    
To promote project based learning in the field of embedded and intelligent devices. To instill the creative spirit in students. To develop oral and written communication skills. To develop students experience of working in a group. To engender an awareness of ethical issues in engineering.
